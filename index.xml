      <description>The year was 2004, the city was Canberra, Australia. The first international tour where I was male lead dancer, it was opening night. Big time!
The show was starting, the hum of the audience dying down as the curtain came up. I was standing offstage left. My warm up was good. Felt nervous but ready to go. The music started slowly. I gave a quick jump to keep blood moving. The main troupe started into their slow choreography on stage.</description>
