    <p>I played a gig with a friend of mine the other week. Two guitars, one vocal with the odd harmony part. Too simple. I needed to over-complicate it.</p>
<p>Two acoustic guitars would not do. I needed to give the audience more by bringing some electric into the mix. Who needs one tuning when you cand have three. Standard, Drop D for something heavier, and DADGAD for that folky sound. Stick to chords? Nah, too boring. We needed be dynamic with solos, keep things fresh for the ear. I must entertain the people!</p>
<p>Sometimes your ambition does not match your available resources. Here my ego was busy writing cheques that my skills could not cash. The gig was crap.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the lack of preparation. I had taken over my neighours vacant shed for three weeks, putting in up to 3 hours a night to learn the material. It wasn’t the crowd. Sure they didn’t acknowledge our presence for the first hour, but once the alcohol kicked in, they got going. Hell, I even got paid!</p>
<p>No, my ego killed the gig. I was too busy chasing the next riff or recovering from missed chord to enjoy myself. Being outside your comfort zone is healthy, being a way too far outside it is panic. My need to impress had set me up for a fall. And fall I did. But it wasn&rsquo;t a complete loss. Towards the end of the set, when at my lowest ebb, we played a stripped back version of a country classic, just finger style acoustic and vocals. Simple. The room went quiet. I got into it.</p>
